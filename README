Thin Bookmarks
==============

Allows to customize the Bookmarks toolbar of Firefox, especially the size.


No distribution via addons.mozilla.org
--------------------------------------

Please note that I will **not** distribute any updates via addons.mozilla.org anymore. I do neither agree, nor support, nor do I wish to be associated with the decisions of Mozilla to:

 * ...turn the addon ecosystem into a walled garden, disallowing and disabling the ability of the user to run any addon they might wish to run.
 * ...drop support for full-fledged addons and instead limit addons to a very, very limited WebExtensions API.

I will only distribute updates via this GitHub page.

With Firefox 57, to be released at the end of 2017, this addon will cease working because support for XUL addons will be dropped. The only workaround I can offer in this regard is to not update Firefox after 56 is released.


Build
-----

Run make...or if you don't know what make is, zip the whole src directory and
change the file ending to xpi.
